# Research Publication Progress Record

This GitHub repository is intended to show the progress record for modified genetic algorithm in correspond with the research publication.
Warning!: This is just a code progress, it hasn't been fully implemented yet.
all the written codes belongs to @sagarabilly.

Feel free to see this as a reference. 

Consist of 3 parts:
1. Gurobi Math Modelling (Math Model.py)
2. Modified Genetic Algorithm (Algorithm SBSRS Checkpoint 2.py)
3. Result testing and Obj.value Calculation (testing with penalty2.py)
